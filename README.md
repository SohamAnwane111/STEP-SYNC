# STEP-SYNC

A step tracking application lets a user calculate daily steps, set goals for a week, create groups to achieve group goals, and gives rewards to individuals who complete their goals. It also maintains leader boards to encourage people to complete steps with great rewards for top 3 individuals. It also has a group leader board where groups are ranked according to steps completed by each group as a whole. We have to design this step tracking application using linked list.

Generate a list of individuals with following fields-

a. ID (unique ID)

b. Name

c. Age

d. Daily Step goal

e. Array of weekly step count (7 days step count recorded)

This list should be sorted on the basis of ID.

Generate a list of groups with following fields-

a. Group-ID

b. Group name

c. Member IDs with pointers to individuals

d. Weekly group goal

This list should be sorted on the basis of Group-ID. A group can contain maximum 5 individuals.

The application should have the following functionalities

a. Add_Person: This function should add a new individual to the list of individuals. The list should remain sorted

b. Create_group: This function should create a new group and be able to add existing individuals to it from the individual list. If an individual already belongs to a group, he cannot be added to a new group.

c. Get_top_3: this function should display the top 3 individuals from the individual list who have completed their daily steps goals and achieved highest number of steps. The individuals who have not completed daily goals but have higher               number of steps should be excluded.

d. Check_group_achievement(Group-ID): This function should display whether the given group has completed its weekly group goal

e. Generate_leader_board: This function should take the group list, sort it in the order of highest number of steps (Descending) completed by each group, and display the group name with number of steps based on rank.

f. Check_individual_rewards(ID): This function should display the rewards earned by the given individual if he is in the top 3 individuals. Rank 1 gets 100 points, rank 2 gets 75 points, and rank 3 gets 50 points

g. Delete_individual(ID): This function should delete an individual from the list of individuals as well as remove him from his groups.

h. Delete_group(Group-ID): This function should delete a group but retain its individuals in the individual list. The individuals are now available to be added to a different group

i. Merge_groups(Group_ID_1, Group_ID_2): Create a new group by merging two groups and set new goals. The original groups should be deleted.

j. Display_group_info(): This function should display information about members in the group as well as group goals and rank

k. Suggest_goal_update(): This function should suggest a daily goal update for an individual such that he/she can consistently appear in the top 3 individuals

For implementing this application, it is desirable to use file handling. You can generate a .txt file for data input. The file should contain data for 20 individuals. Generate 5 groups with varying number of members and some members who do not belong to any group.
